    Build 3D and XR scenes and games using reactive programming, reusable
    components, and hooks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Declarative API" icon="puzzle">
    The Babylon.js API is mostly covered declaratively thanks to code generation
    and even custom props allow you to declaratively add shadows, physics, 3D
    models, attach 2D/3D UI to meshes, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hooks / TS / Context API" icon="star">
    Fully supports hooks. Full support for TypeScript with auto-completion on
    elements and compile time checks. Context API and hooks provide easy access
    to Scene/Engine/Canvas.
