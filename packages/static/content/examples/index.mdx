These examples mostly serve to highlight various examples to explain
`react-babylonjs` usage for different components.

These include how materials are automatically assigned (or choosing where to
assign), but also how to build a GUI and more advanced topics like post
processing, multiple scenes/canvases and also how to use integrate a physics
library and many more!
